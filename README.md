# cwl-draft3-to-v1-parser


This tool is tailored to convert [Duke-GCB/GGR-cwl](https://github.com/Duke-GCB/GGR-cwl) draft-3 CWL files to v1.0.
 
 
There is an official [cwl-upgrader](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl-upgrader) tool mantained by the community which should be more general. Since the code in the aformentioned repo was written in a mash-up of CWL standards, we came up with this ad-hoc solution.
